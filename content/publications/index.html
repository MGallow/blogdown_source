<h4><em>“In their 2017 paper, Shrinking Characteristics of Precision Matrix Estimators, Molstad and Rothman propose a framework to shrink a user-specified precision matrix characteristic needed to fit a predictive model. Inspired by Fisher’s LDA and its unique classification characteristic, this framework also has applications to multivariate regression and allows for many novel precision matrix estimators. In this research, we outline the estimation methods and show that these new estimators can outperform lasso regression, ridge regression, and other more popular competing methods in high dimensional settings. As a result of this work, two packages (ADMMsigma and SCPME) have since been published to CRAN and they will be briefly mentioned.”</em></h4>

<h4><em>“Mortgage defaults played a critical role in the recent (2008) financial crisis. Accordingly, the practice and foundations of subprime lending have received great attention in the literature. Crucial to these conversations is an understanding of the inherent risk in subprime lending. The following is an attempt to model the time-to-default (risk) of various mortgage cohorts using contemporary statistical modeling methods and two competing models. This is joint work with Dr. Arkady Shemyakin and Dr. Alicia Johnson.”</em></h4>
