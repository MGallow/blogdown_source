<h4><em>“Mortgage defaults played a critical role in the recent (2008) financial crisis. Accordingly, the practice and foundations of subprime lending have received great attention in the literature. Crucial to these conversations is an understanding of the inherent risk in subprime lending. The following is an attempt to model the time-to-default (risk) of various mortgage cohorts using contemporary statistical modeling methods and two competing models. This is joint work with Dr. Arkady Shemyakin and Dr. Alicia Johnson.”</em></h4>
