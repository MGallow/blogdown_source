      <description>Previously a consultant at the Institute for Research on Statistics and its Applications (IRSA) at the University of Minnesota. Currently working as a freelance data scientist in the Twin Cities area.
I was previously a Ph.D. student in statistics at the University of Minnesota. My research was advised by Adam J. Rothman, Ph.D. and broadly related to efficient precision matrix estimation.
In May 2015, I received my B.S. and B.A. from the University of St.</description>

      <description>Galloway, M, Johnson, A., and Shemyakin, A. (2017). Time-to-Default Analysis of Mortgage Portfolios. Model Assisted Statistics and Applications 12.4 (2017): 359-367. [pdf]
“Mortgage defaults played a critical role in the recent (2008) financial crisis. Accordingly, the practice and foundations of subprime lending have received great attention in the literature. Crucial to these conversations is an understanding of the inherent risk in subprime lending. The following is an attempt to model the time-to-default (risk) of various mortgage cohorts using contemporary statistical modeling methods and two competing models.</description>

      <description>My research interests include statistical machine learning, multivariate analysis, precision matrix estimation, sufficient dimension reduction, and kernel methods (among others).
R Packages ADMMsigma Estimates a penalized precision matrix via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.
 GLASSOO Estimates a penalized precision matrix via block-wise coordinate descent – also known as the graphical lasso (glasso) algorithm.
