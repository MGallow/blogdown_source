      <description>Galloway, M, Johnson, A., and Shemyakin, A. (2017). Time-to-Default Analysis of Mortgage Portfolios. Model Assisted Statistics and Applications 12.4 (2017): 359-367. [pdf]
“Mortgage defaults played a critical role in the recent (2008) financial crisis. Accordingly, the practice and foundations of subprime lending have received great attention in the literature. Crucial to these conversations is an understanding of the inherent risk in subprime lending. The following is an attempt to model the time-to-default (risk) of various mortgage cohorts using contemporary statistical modeling methods and two competing models.</description>

      <description>My research interests include statistical machine learning, multivariate analysis, precision matrix estimation, sufficient dimension reduction, and kernel methods (among others).
R Packages ADMMsigma Estimates a penalized precision matrix via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.
 Omega Estimates a penalized precision matrix via various estimation methods. OMEGA combines ADMMsigma and GLASSOO (along with other estimation methods) into a complete package.
 GLASSOO Estimates a penalized precision matrix via block-wise coordinate descent – also known as the graphical lasso (glasso) algorithm.</description>
