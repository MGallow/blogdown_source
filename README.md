# Personal Website


This is the source code (slightly modified) for my personal website which you can find [here](https://mattxgalloway.com) or [here](https://mgallow.github.io/). Note that I have excluded several images and documents from the "images" repository.

You are welcome to clone this repository and tweak the code to your liking.

The website was built with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) & [Goa](https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa) theme.
